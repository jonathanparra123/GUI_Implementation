#GUI_APPLICATIONS

-Building GUIs with Java and JavaFX.

-Games and fun projects to help me uderstand GUIs.

-The first couple projects are just basic UIs only 
using Java.

****************************************************

Fizzy.java is just a small project that helped me 
understand the syntax for Java. It just calculates
which numbers are multiples of 3 and 5.

****************************************************

Basic_GUI is a simple UI that takes user input
such as names, ages, and phone numbers then stores
the data in an external file that is in a 
folder called data. The programs also lets you 
calculate the average for all the ages from the data. 
The program writes out and in for the purpose of storing 
the data in case the program ends.
