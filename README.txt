#GUI_APPLICATIONS

-Building GUIs with Java and JavaFX.

-Games and fun projects to help me uderstand GUIs.

-The first couple projects are just basic UIs only 
using Java.

*******************************************************

Fizzy.java is just a small project that helped me 
understand the syntax for Java. It just calculates
which numbers are multiples of 3 and 5.

*******************************************************

Basic_UI is a simple UI that takes user input
such as names, ages, and phone numbers then stores
the data in an external file that is in a 
folder called data. The programs also lets you 
calculate the average for all the ages from the data. 
The program writes out and in for the purpose of 
storing the data in case the program ends.

********************************************************

GUI_PicFolder is a project where you can add a URL
of any image that you want and it will store and
display the same image in a GUI, furthermore you can
also iterate through past images added. The program also
comes with a delete option which completely removes
specific pictures. When initializing the program
the pics are taken from a file data Please notate that 
adding a picture of porpotionate size might cause some 
displaying issues.

*********************************************************

GUI_Canvas is a GUI that lets you place and resize shapes
such as any number of rectangles, ellipses, and lines.
The program uses multiple event action handlers in order
to accurately keep up with user input. Lastly, I did add
a erase method as let the users erase any shapes they have
created. The panes, buttons, tiles and popup screens were 
created using the JavaFX libraries.

**********************************************************

GUI_Drawing_Shapes is an improved version of GUI_Canvas in 
which instead of having a pop up window to choose a shape it
will display the options from the start. The options include
drawing an ellipes, rectangle, and free hand draw. Apart 
from being able to draw the shapes, you can also choose the
color inside the shape and even change the color and size 
of the stroke. The program also comes with a erase method in 
order to clear the targeted object.
